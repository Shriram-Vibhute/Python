# Types of data used for I/O:
'''
- Text - '12345' as a sequence of unicode chars
- Binary - 12345 as a sequence of bytes of its binary equivalent
'''

# Hence there are 2 file types to deal with
'''
- Text files - All program files are text files
- Binary Files - Images,music,video,exe files
'''

# How File I/O is done in most programming languages
'''
- Open a file
- Read/Write data
- Close the file
'''

# since file is closed hence this will not work

# Pickle Vs Json
'''
- Pickle lets the user to store data in binary format. JSON lets the user store data in a human-readable text format.
'''

# Error - When you run a pickle file on your devide which is made onto another device you will get an error - Cant get attribut 'class_name' on module __main__ - This is because The error you're encountering is likely due to the fact that the class definition of the object being unpickled is not available in the current namespace. When you pickle an object, the pickle module stores the module and class names, but not the actual class definition. When you unpickle the object, Python needs to be able to find the class definition in the same module and with the same name.
