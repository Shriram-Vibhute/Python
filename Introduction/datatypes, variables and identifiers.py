# Interview Questions - What is the difference between Static/Dynamic Typing and Static/Dynamic Binding?
'''
Actually, Dynamic Binding is a method resolution at runtime concept in OOPs - Which method has to get executed will be determined at runtime (Method overriding - Polymorphsm). This is also called "Late Binding"
'''

# Compile time vs Runtime
'''
Compile Time: The phase when the code is being written
Run Time: The phase when the compiled code is executed

__ = 20 # Used in OOP - Name Mangling

# Perform some calculations

# Type Conversion - Changing the data type of a variable
# Implicit - Automatically done by the interpreter
print(10 + 20.5) # 30.5
print(10 + True) # 11
print("Hello" + 10) # Error - Cannot concatenate string with int

# Explicit - Done by the programmer
print("Hello" + str(10)) # Hello10
print(int(10.5)) # 10

print(int(3 + 4j)) # Error
print(str(3 + 4j)) # Able to convert - In fact anything is able to convert into string

# Differencing between "Type Conversion" and "Type Casting"
'''
- Type Casting - This is the process of explicitly changing a variable from one datatype to another
int('5')
- Type Conversion - Type conversion involves changing a variable from one data type to another, which can occur either implicitly or explicitly.

# The print function does not return any value (returns None), so
