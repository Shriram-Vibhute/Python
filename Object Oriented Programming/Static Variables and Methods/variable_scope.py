    # Enclosing Scope:
    # do_nonlocal() modifies a variable in the enclosing scope (i.e., the spam variable in the scope_test() function). The nonlocal keyword allows do_nonlocal() to change the spam variable that was defined in scope_test(), not a new local variable.

    do_global()
    print("After global assignment:", spam)
    # Global Scope:
    # do_global() uses the global keyword to modify the spam variable in the global scope, meaning it will affect the spam variable defined outside of the scope_test() function.

scope_test()
print("In global scope:", spam) # Value will be changed due to do_global function


# Note -> nonlocal only work when it find the existance of nonlocal variable and not as global variable.
