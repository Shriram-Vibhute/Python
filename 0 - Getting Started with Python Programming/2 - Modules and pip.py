'''
pip is the package installer for Python."pip" does not have a universally accepted full form in Python. It allows you to install, manage, and update Python libraries and packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and other repositories. Essentially, it's a tool that helps you easily add external libraries to your Python environment, which can provide additional functionality or simplify development tasks.

# Import the hashlib module from the Python standard library.
# This module provides various hashing algorithms.
import hashlib  # This is an example of a built-in module.

# Import the pandas library, which is an external library used for data manipulation and analysis.
import pandas  # This is an example of an external module.

# Import the train_test_split function from scikit-learn's model_selection module.
# This function is used for splitting data into training and testing sets.
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split as tts  # Importing required functions only.

# Example usage of pandas to read a CSV file into a DataFrame.
# Replace "one.csv" with the path to your actual CSV file.
df = pandas.read_csv("one.csv")

# Example usage of hashlib to create a SHA-256 hash object.
# This hash object can be used to hash data.
m = hashlib.sha256()

# Example of updating the hash object with data.
# Replace 'data' with the actual data you want to hash (must be in bytes).
data = b'example data'  # Ensure the data is in bytes, not a string.
m.update(data)

# To obtain the hexadecimal digest of the hashed data.
digest = m.hexdigest()
print(f"SHA-256 Hash: {digest}")

# Example usage of train_test_split to split data into training and testing sets.
# Assuming df has features and a target column, for example, 'target'.
# Replace 'features' and 'target' with actual column names or arrays.
X = df[['feature1', 'feature2']]  # Replace with actual feature columns.
y = df['target']  # Replace with the actual target column.

# Splitting the data into training and testing sets with a 80-20 split ratio.
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = tts(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Print the shapes of the resulting datasets to verify the split.
print(f"Training features shape: {X_train.shape}")
print(f"Testing features shape: {X_test.shape}")
print(f"Training target shape: {y_train.shape}")
print(f"Testing target shape: {y_test.shape}")
