# Difference between == and is
'''
== operator compares just the values
is operator compares the identity of varibles -> True if both the variables are pointing to same memory location

Immutable Types: For some immutable types like small integers and strings, Python may reuse objects for efficiency. For example:
a = 1000
b = 1000
print(a == b)  # True
print(a is b)  # True (due to internal optimization in CPython for small integers)
